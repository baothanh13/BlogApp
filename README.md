# Connectify Blog App

## Introduction

Welcome to Connectify, a basic yet engaging blog application built for Android using Kotlin. This project was developed as part of a mobile development course with the goal of creating a platform where users can connect, share their thoughts, and interact with each other through the power of written content.

With Connectify, you can:

* **Login and Register:** Securely create a new account if you don't have one, or log in to an existing account to access the app's features.
* **Create Posts:** Share your stories, ideas, and updates with the community by easily creating and publishing your own blog posts.
* **Read Posts:** Discover and explore a feed of content from other users within the Connectify community. Stay informed and engage with diverse perspectives.
* **Save Posts:** Found a post that resonates with you? Save it to your personal collection to revisit and read later at your convenience.
* **Edit Profile:** Personalize your Connectify experience by updating your profile information to better reflect yourself within the community.

This app aims to provide a simple and intuitive way for people to connect and share their experiences, knowledge, and opinions through the medium of blog posts. It's a foundational step towards building a connected community.
